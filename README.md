â†“ Stickify Server
===================
 - User account setup is ad hoc. A user's PIN and sticky notes will be wiped if the user does not "send stickies" in a certain amount of time from [Sticky Pusher](https://github.com/ansonl/stickify-pusher/). This expiry period can be adjusted in the `userExpireSeconds` global variable in the code. 
	 - `userExpireSeconds` is currently set to 24 hours.
	 - The expiry for a user is reset when whenever the user updates stickies through a successful POST request to `/update`.
